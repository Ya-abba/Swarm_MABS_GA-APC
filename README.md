# Swarm_MABS_GA-APC
This repository contains the implementation of a novel Swarm UAV path-planning algorithm leveraging GA and clustering techniques for optimizing disaster response networks (DRNs). The code includes simulations for coverage optimization, mobility modeling, QoS compliance, tested with realistic datasets across diverse environmental scenarios.
